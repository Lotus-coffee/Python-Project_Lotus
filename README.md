# Python-Project_Lotus
This goal of this project is to predict whether an applicant is approval for a loan.

I joined the playground prediction competition on kaggle and downloaded the data from the website. In this project, I will use area under the ROC curve to evaluate the results.

For the submission, there will be two columns with just ID and loan status, which can 
tell if a applicant is approval for a loan.

Conclusion:

About the dataset:

The data includes a test data file and a train data file, with columns as applicant id, applicant's age, applicant's income, applicant's home ownership, applicant's employment length, loan intention, loan grade,loan amount, loan interest rate, loan percent income, and loan approval.

For the loan grade column, The letter grades that are assigned to loans indicate the expected risk of the loan. Loans graded A have the lowest expected risk of loss and therefore pay the lender the lowest interest rate. On the other hand, G loans have the highest expected risk of loss. Accordingly, G loans pay the highest interest rate in order to compensate lenders for the increased risk relative to an A loan.
